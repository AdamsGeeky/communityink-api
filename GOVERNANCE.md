# 🏛️ CommunityInk Governance

> **"Built by students, for students — governed by the community."**  
> This document defines how decisions are made, who leads what, and how contributors can take on more responsibility within the **CommunityInk Open Source Project**.

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this governance model is to ensure that:
- **Decisions are transparent, inclusive, and fair.**
- **Contributors can grow** into leadership roles based on merit and commitment.
- **The project remains sustainable** as it grows across campuses.

CommunityInk is a **community-led open-source project** — powered by student developers, mentors, and volunteers from around the world.

## 💬 Decision-Making Process

CommunityInk follows a **consensus-driven model**:

| Level | Process |
|--------|----------|
| **Everyday Decisions** | Made by contributors and module leads through pull requests and discussions. |
| **Feature Additions** | Proposed via GitHub issues → discussed → approved by maintainers. |
| **Major Changes** | Formalized in **CommunityInk Proposals (CIPs)** — a lightweight RFC process. |
| **Disagreements** | Resolved through discussion; maintainers have final authority if consensus fails. |

---

## 📜 Meetings & Communication

- **Weekly Syncs (Optional):** Maintainers and leads discuss progress.
- **Monthly Community Calls:** Open to all members to share updates, ideas, and plans.
- **Discord Server:** Primary hub for communication and collaboration.

Meeting summaries are shared publicly for transparency.

## 🧭 Principles of Governance

CommunityInk’s governance is built on five guiding principles:

1. **Transparency:** Decisions, discussions, and outcomes are open.  
2. **Inclusivity:** Every voice matters — beginners and experts alike.  
3. **Meritocracy:** Leadership is earned through contribution and collaboration.  
4. **Accountability:** Roles come with responsibilities, not privileges.  
5. **Sustainability:** Governance evolves as the project and community grow.

---

## 🪴 Future Evolution

This governance model is **version 1.0** and will evolve with the project.  
As CommunityInk expands to more universities and contributors, we’ll introduce:
- A **Campus Ambassador Program** to represent local communities.  
- A **Community Council** to handle mentorship and outreach.  
- A **Voting System** for key proposals and elections.
